## Classification of texts using Transformer
In this exercise, the goal is to categorize texts based on the use of the pre-trained BERT model. The target data in this exercise is Persica data. 
Persica is a body containing news texts taken from ISNA news agency. The texts of this body are classified in eleven subject categories, including sports,
economic, cultural, religious, historical, political, scientific, social, educational, legal, and health, and pre-processed in order to be usable in various
applications of natural language processing and data mining on them. It has been done. Separate the data into two parts: training (80%) and test (20%) and use
the training part for pre-training the model. Implement the implemented system to categorize the documents of the test set and calculate its performance accuracy
for different parameters and different pre-trained models (ParsBERT and multilingual models) and the observations and results in Present a report format and compare
it with the results obtained in the previous exercise.
