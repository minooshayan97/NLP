## POS tagging
In this exercise, the goal is to categorize the part of speech of the words in a text using the Viterbi algorithm. The given data is divided into training and test sections,
with a label in front of each word. Implement the labeling algorithm, calculate the parameters of the model based on the part of the training data, and finally 
implement the implemented algorithm to label each sentence of the test set and calculate the accuracy of the algorithm's performance.
