## Statistical language modeling
Prepare a desired Farsi text in a specific field (for example, sports or medicine) with at least 20,000 words. Extract unigram, bigram and trigram linguistic models from this text and perform the smoothing process with different smoothing methods (both those you learned in this lesson and other methods). Then obtain the perplexity (result of each of these models on a new text from the same field (with at least 2000 words) (for different language models and different smoothing methods) and display it in the form of a table or chart. Describe the work steps and interpret the results.
Note: The use of existing linguistic modeling tools (IRSTLM, Toolkit SRLLM, Toolkit SLM CMUToolkit) is allowed.
