## document classification
In this exercise, the aim of classifying texts based on the concepts of word-document matrix; The SVD (LSA) matrix analysis method. First, convert the SVD analysis
of each document into a vector using the concepts of the word-document matrix, and then use three different classifiers to classify the texts. The target data in 
this exercise is Persica data. Persica is a dataset containing news texts taken from ISNA news agency. The texts of this body are classified in eleven subject categories
including sports, economic, cultural, religious, historical, political, scientific, social, educational, judicial law and health. 

Pre-processing has been done on them in order to be usable in various applications of natural language processing and data mining. Separate the data into two parts:
training (80%) and test (20%). There is no need to implement SVD and categories, and you are allowed to use ready-made tools and codes. Calculate its performance for
different parameters, such as the length vector of each document, etc., and different classification methods.
